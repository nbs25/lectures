## Where to Go for Help
* Barring apocalypse, you will spend the rest of your life with information and tutorials on almost every subject quickly available.
 - I am not teaching for the apocalpyse.
* You will spend most of your life not in the classroom.
* My job is to teach you how to learn on your own.
* If there is a video explaining something: watch it.
* If there is a document explaining something: read it.
* I will use my expertise to help curate a list of selected tutorials and videos, but there will always be many more.
* Our time together is valuable for its opportunity for **interaction**.

* I will be around during ``working time'' during each class after lecture time.
* Office hours: Wednesday 11:00-12:00
* Make an appointment to meet with me.
* Lots of Python help available online!

## Arrays and Numpy

* Numbers are more efficiently stored and manipulated in \textit{arrays} than in lists or tuples.
* We will use arrays created by the NumPy library, which is the standard for arrays in Python.
* Today we will
 - Learn to plot (visualize) function curves
 - Learn to store points on curves in arrays (lists)

* Curves y = f (x ) are visualized by drawing straight line between consequtive points along the curve
* We need to store the coordinates of the points along the curve in lists or arrays x and y
* Arrays are like lists, but much computationally more efficient
 - The tradeoff is that they are less flexible.
* To compute the y coordinates (in an array) we need to learn about array computations or vectorization
* Array computations are useful for much more than plotting curves!
* When we need to compute with large amounts of numbers, we store the numbers in arrays and compute with arrays â€“ this gives shorter and faster code

## Plotting

* `matplotlib` is the main 2-D plotting package in Python.
* Interactive Tutorial and exercise on plotting...
* See `primer-5_subset.pdf`
